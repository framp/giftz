An OSS application to manage encrypted giftcards.

WIP but functional if you like to fiddle.

## How to use

 - Visit https://giftz.framp.me/keys/new
 - Generate a key
 - Add your cards data in the textarea (or drag a file onto it) following the format:
```js
[{
  "barcode": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAATgAAABkAQMAAAAoir4RAAAABlBMVEX///8AAABVwtN+AAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAEpJREFUSIntyrEJADEIQNGAreAqwrVCVhccwFUObA+SKa77r35rrPw1kRDNnKoO8/BWmdKzY2ueJ79ePB6Px+PxeDwej8fj8X57Fyyp9/PFewItAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC",
  "number": "6341753502310869272",
  "pin": "1234",
  "amount": 20,
  "currency": "Â£",
  "id": "1"
}]
```
 - Barcode can be:
   - A base64 encoded image
   - A value to be rendered with CODE128
   - An object `{ value, ...options }` to configure [JsBarcode](https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode)
 - Get the `/keys/#....` link from the bottom input, send it safely to your target device 
 - Get the `/cards/#....` links from the bottom textbox, store them safely and send them to your device of choice without worrying about safety (a man in the middle will need to have the key from the previous step or access to your device to decrypt them)

## Tech
